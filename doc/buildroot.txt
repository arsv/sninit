Buildroot system for sninit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sninit comes with a set of pre-defined configurations for Buildroot
which allow building a bootable system image for qemu with sninit
set up as process #1. This is intended for testing overall usabitiy
of sninit by interacting with a running system.

Check http://buildroot.uclibc.org/ for overall information on Buildroot.
For the logic behind sninit-supplied configuration, check
http://buildroot.uclibc.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#outside-br-custom

The files are stored in misc/buildroot directory within sninit source tree. 


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* buildroot-2015.08.1
  With minor tweaks, other buildroot versions should work as well.
  Get it from http://buildroot.uclibc.org/

* buildroot dependencies installed, see list here:
  http://buildroot.uclibc.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement-mandatory

* qemu-system-$arch installed
  This typically comes with distro's qemu package.
  Which arch is needed depends on defconfig used (see below),
  but in most cases they all come in a single package.  

* internet connection
  buildroot will download ~250MB of source tarballs

* lots of patience and up to 5GB of free disk space
  (all that to test a couple of executable totalling ~20KB, yeah)


Building and running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unpack Buildroot-2015.08.1 somewhere outside of sninit directory.

For convenience, set the following variables:

    BR=/path/to/unpacked/buildroot/source
    SN=/path/to/unpacked/sninit/source

so that $BR/toolchain and $SN/test are both existing directories.

Initialize buildroot, and check available configs:

    cd $BR
    make BR2_EXTERNAL=$SN/misc/buildroot list-defconfigs

It should output a long list with several sninit_(arch)_defconfigs
at the very bottom. Choose one of them, and set it as current:

    make sninit_(arch)_defconfig

Once that's done, proceed to build the image:

    make

This part will likely take significant time.
When it's done, it should leave a symlink $BR/qemu poiting to one
of qemu* scripts in $SN/misc/buildroot/. Run it from $BR directory:

    ./qemu

The emulated system should boot, showing login: prompt in qemu graphic
window if everything went well. Login as root and use telinit to communicate
with the running sninit.


Troubleshooting the build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In case the build fails before it gets to sninit, try building a clean Buildroot
system without using supplied defconfigs to factor out possible bugs in defconfigs.
Make sure to match target architecture and kernel configuration. Compare variable
values in $SN/misc/buildroot/configs/sninit_(arch)_defconfig with what happens
to be in $BR/.config after running menuconfig.

In case sninit build fails, a quick way to re-try it (to get output and such):
	rm -fr output/build/snint*
	make
Most buildroot commands can be re-run manually:
	cd output/build/sninit*
	./configure CC=...
	make
Once you're done fixing, run top-level make to finish the build and produce
the final image. Buildroot is mostly make-based, and it generally won't overwrite
stuff that has been built.

Buildroot used hidden timestamp files to track completed actions.
For sninit, these are:
	
	output/build/sninit*/.stamp_downloaded
	output/build/sninit*/.stamp_extracted
	output/build/sninit*/.stamp_patched
	output/build/sninit*/.stamp_configured
	output/build/sninit*/.stamp_built
	output/build/sninit*/.stamp_target_installed

Remove/touch them to re-do/skip specific actions during top-level make run.


Troubleshooting runtime issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For hard qemu errors (incorrect command line options, kernel not booting), check
qemu(1) *and* sample commands from $BR/boards/qemu/(arch)/README.
All sninit defconfigs are based on Buildroot qemu defconfigs, so those can be used
to exclude sninit as a possible cause of failure.

In case sninit fails to start or does not work properly, start by adding
init=/bin/sh to kernel command line like this:

	qemu-system-arm ... -append "root=/dev/sda init=/bin/sh"

The system should boot into sh prompt. With sh running, you can start /sbin/init,
or possibly gdbserver:

	gdbserver /dev/ttyS0 /sbin/init

Check $SN/doc/qemu.txt for notes on remote debugging.


Serial console and gdb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some targets (MIPS) have no emulated framebuffer console, and need two serial
devices: one for login console and one for gdb:

	qemu-system-mips ... -serial pty -serial stdio

In this case, gdbserver should be started on /dev/ttyS0 and getty should get /dev/ttyS1.

To have kernel output on stdout, add console=ttyS1 to the kernel command line:

	qemu-system-mips ... -append "root=/dev/sda console=ttyS1"

The same trick may be used if framebuffer console is available but for some reason
serial one is preferred; qemu -display none may be used to suppress graphical window.

Beware -nographic does a lot more than -display none, and will require additional setup.
