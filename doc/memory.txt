Memory usage in sinit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At a glance, memory map looks like this:

	* .text 4+ pages
		code and some strings
	* .data/.bss 1 page
		global state variables
		struct memblocks and config pointers
		(possibly built-in config)
		large buffers for warn(), readinitdir(), readcmd()
	* cfgblock area, mmaped, 1+ page
		compiled configuration currently in use
	* newblock area, mmaped, 1+ page
		newly compiled replacement for cfgblock
	* stack, 1 page
		call frames and small local variables

Reconfiguration involves mmaping newblock, setting up data there,
exchanging newblock with cfgblock and unmapping the (old) cfgblock.
Other than than, the map is static; the only thing that ever grows
is newblock. Stack is not expected to grow beyond a single page,
due to small call depth.

See init_conf.h for config block layout.


Offsets, pointers and MAP_MAYMOVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reconfiguration code assumes newblock area address may change whenever
its size is increased. Or in other words, mremap(..., MAP_MAYMOVE).
Which means offsets from the start of the block are used instead of
proper pointers throughout the configuration.

Assuming a conventional Linux systems, this is not necessary, almost,
since a pair of (presumably free) fixed locations may be chosen and
cfgblock/newblock may be always mmaped at those locations. There is
more than enough address space, so it is not going to bump into .text,
or .data or stack, assuming we know at least roughly where those are
and there is not libc parts in the typical mmaped address range.

That's a lot of assumptions actually, and things get much worse once
non-MMU targets are considered. On the flip side, rewritepointers
and relevant offset work in checkdupname is not that much of a hassle, 
code size increase is negligible, so why bother.

Why convert offsets to pointers in the end, as opposed to using offsets
throughout? Well, syscalls need proper pointers either way, and the idea
was to keeping all dirty pointer work within configure().


Pages and bss buffers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Everything writable outside of the config blocks could very well fit
within a single memory page. That includes the stack.

However, getting rid of .bss is extremely difficult (consider errno),
and once .bss is there, it's at least one page. Getting rid of stack
is not possible either.

With both .bss and stack available, .bss is clearly preferable for anything
that can possibly overflow and/or does not fit in registers.
Since there are no re-enterable functions in sninit, this means any local
buffers should better go to .bss.


Heap and brk
~~~~~~~~~~~~
On MMU systems, it is possible (and to some degree natural) to store cfgblock
and newblock in the heap:

	brk -> cfgblock
	       newblock
	       (space for newblock to grow)
	       ...

The downside is that this does not simplify the code at all and requires
extensive workarounds for non-MMU cases.

Tradeoff between sbrk and mmap/mremap/munmap is negligible, considering brk
syscall vs libc brk/sbrk semantics and the ugliness of coding around that.
Moving newblock over cfgblock once configuration is done requires repointing
everything just like in MAP_MAYMOVE case. Implementing (or using) some kind
of malloc means unnecessary code complication and memory losses all around.
