Initial console issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most unix applications expect fds 0, 1 and 2 (stdin, stdout, stderr
respectively) to be open by the time their _start code is invoked.

Typically these fds are inherited as is from the parent process,
which in turn gets them from its parent and so on.

Some processes may choose to open or dup something explicitly onto
fds 0-2, but some just as well may not. This way it may come up to
init to make sure the fds are in fact open.


Why is this important
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An unsuspecting process may end up opening something unrelated into
fd 2 and then messing it up by writing to stderr:

	int fd = open("some/important/file", O_WRONLY);
	/* fd happens to be 2 here */

	if(unrelatedsyscall(...) < 0)
		perror("unrelatedsyscall");
		/* ^ writes to some/important/file */

Writes to stderr may occur in unexpected places, and in practice any
application is should be treated as capable of writing to fd 2.
The problem is less severe with fd 1 and non-existant for read-only fd 0.

True (forking) daemons are expected to close their fds 0-2 around
the time they fork to cut their ties to the controlling terminal,
and only use syslog past that point.
However, the use of fd 2 is not restricted before the fork point.


Kernel side of the problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What exactly does process #1 get on fds 0-2 when it's started?
The answer is, quite surprisignly, "it depends".

When booting without the use of initramfs, the kernel does

	fd = open("/dev/console", O_RDWR);
	dup(fd);
	dup(fd);

which, _if_successful_, provides init with /dev/console open on all three fds.
The kernel however does not check whether open succeeds. And there are at least
two ways in which it can fail:

1. /dev/console (the file) is missing (ENOENT)
2. console is not configured (ENODEV, ENXIO etc)

If this happens, init gets nothing on fds 0-2.

When booting with initramfs, the code above is *skipped* altogether,
and init unconditionally gets no open fds.
Initramfs is expected to contain an intermediate init that opens /dev/console
and spawns the real one among other things.


How to handle it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At present sninit attempts to keep fds unchanges if they happen to be open.
This is checked by calling fcntl(F_GETFD) on fd 2 only, partially because
the kernel opens either all three or none, and partially because fd 2
is the only one sninit itself depends on.

An alternative is to close 0, 1, 2 and proceed to open /dev/console as if
nothing has been supplied by the kernel. This however requires more syscalls
and needs special treatment for devel builds, as non-priviledged users are
not allowed to open it.

No fds open fds in non-initramfs case mean /dev/console cannot be opened
for whatever reason. In this case, a desperate attempt to open at least
something is made, said "something" being /dev/null or / (the root directory).
Having something non-writable on fds 1 and 2 is enough to prevent undesired
effects, and since the console is not available anyway it's probably ok
to drop any actual writes to fd 2.

It is probably never a good idea to try opening /dev/console:

	* If we're not booting into initramfs, the kernel has already tried
	  that, and failed. No point in trying it again.

	* If we are, initramfs /init will have to set it up, among other things,
	  handling the fine distinction between initramfs:/dev/console and
	  realroot:/dev/console so that switch_root would do its job properly.

With initramfs, the pre-init executable initramfs:/init should be a dedicated
executable, as its job is nothing like what a proper init does. What it should
do is brining the system close to non-initramfs-boot state, and exec into
the real init.


Runnig without initial console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are at least two ways to make open(/dev/console) fail with ENODEV:
not configuring a console at all (no CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE for instance)
and passing "console=" with no value to the kernel command line.

The latter is exactly what Chromebook u-boot does.

It's not bad per se, and actually it's a pretty straighforward way
to hide console output. Which is why Chromebook does it.
So what init needs to do is to comply, letting any output from its
children sink into /dev/null.

Inability to open /dev/console is not a reason to abort system startup.
