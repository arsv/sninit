Sublevels
~~~~~~~~~
There are two kinds of runlevels in sninit: primary runlevels 0, 1, 2, ... 9,
and sublevels a, b, c, d, e, f. Sublevels extend the notion of ondemand
runlevels from sysvinit.

Sublevels go in the runlevels field in inittab together with the primary
runlevels. Here's how they affect when an initrec will be started:

	123	runlevels 1, 2 or 3, regardless of sublevels
	12a	runlevels 1 or 2, but only if sublevel a is active
	12ab	runlevels 1 or 2, but only if at least one of sublevels a, b is active
	(empty)	all runlevels except 0
	ab	all runlevels except 0 if either a or b is active

Primary runlevels are mutually exclusive; sninit can only be in one of them.
Sublevels aren't exclusive, and any set of sublevels can be active at any
given time. To control currently active sublevels, use + and - commands
in telinit:

	telinit +a

activates sublevel a,

	telinit -bc

deactivates sublevels b and c.


Sysvinit compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When used without specifying primary runlevels, sublevels act just like ondemand
runlevels in sysvinit. Specifically,
	
	name:a:ondemand:command

in sysvinit translates into
	
	name:a::command

in sninit. Telinit commands are somewhat different, in sninit it's always "+a" instead
of just "a" to activate sublevel a.


Init state and switching sublevels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The actual runlevels sninit switches between are combinations of one primary runlevel
and some (possibly empty) set of sublevels. The complete runlevel after

	telinit 4
	telinit +ac

will be "4ac", that is, primary level 4 with sublevels a and c activated.
Activating sublevel b in this situation with
	
	telinit +b

would result in sninit switching from runlevel "4ac" to to runlevel "4abc", running
r-type entries if necessary just like when switching primary runlevels.

Currently switching primary runlevel results in the change of the primary runlevel
only, i.e. in the above situation running

	telinit 5

will move sninit to runlevel "5abc", not just "5". This may or may not change in the future.


Rationale
~~~~~~~~~
While relatively easy to implement, ondemand runlevels are not among sysvinit's most used
features. Actually, their role in sysvinit is similar to the role of initrec names
in sninit: starting/stopping processes on the fly with telinit. There are only three of them,
so they are not terribly useful, but the idea is the same anyway.

In sninit, the main reason for implementing sublevels was handling independent aspects
of system state, specifically laptop power mode.

Power modes behave a lot like runlevels, in that there are some script to run when switching
to battery power, there are some scripts to run when going back to mains and so on.
However, save for some special cases, the switch between battery and mains does not warrant
a change in the running daemons — or equivalently, and change in the (primary) runlevel.

Sublevels provide a reasonably clean and readable way to handle this situation.
Having battery/mains mode as a sublevel means primary runlevels can be used solely for
managing running daemons.


Initial state and negated conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One possible drawback of the current implementation is that it makes it hard to do
things like "keep the process running UNLESS sublevel x is active".
This is only important because the initial state of the sublevels is all-0.

For the laptop power mode problem, it is not really relevant. Laptop can very well start
on battery, so it's always a matter of checking the state during startup.

For other cases, the only solution for now is having some of sublevels set in INITDEFAULT.


Negated primary runlevels mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tilde in inittab affects primary runlevels only.
That is, "123a" means "levels 1, 2 or 3 with sublevel a active",
and "~123a" means "any level except 1, 2 or 3 with sublevel a active", or equivalently,
"levels 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with sublevel a active".

As stated above, negating sublevels mask makes little sense.
Atop of that, the intended usage implies adding "a" to "~123" should work more or less
the same way as adding "a" to "0456789".
