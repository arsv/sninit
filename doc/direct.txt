Direct configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Traditionally sysvinit-based systems leaned towards data-only
configuration files supplemented by generic distro-supplied
configuration scripts. The script use the data from configuration
files to call system utilities.

In contrast to that, "direct configuration" means treating
the commands itself as configuration keywords, and using immediate
values instead of referencing variables.


Example and motivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's see how linux console charset and keyboard layout was configured in
(pre-systemd) Arch linux.

	/etc/rc.conf	(host-specific file)
		CHARSET=utf-8
		KEYMAP="ru-utf"
		FONT=UniCyr_8x16

	/etc/rc.sysninit	(common for all Arch systems)
		if [ -n "$FONT" ]; then
			if [ -n "$KEYMAP" ]; then
				loadfont -m $KEYMAP $FONT
			else
				loadfont $FONT
			fi
		fi

Now loadkeys source contains basically the same if() statement:

		/* load font */
		if(/* -m option was supplied */)
			/* load keymap */

rc.conf adds a wrapper atop of loadfont, without actually changing (simplifying) anything.
The above code can simply be replaced with

	/etc/rc.local	(host-specific file)
		loadfont -m ru-utf UniCyr_8x16

or maybe just
		loadfont UniCyr_8x16

or maybe just skipped if there's no need to load font (empty FONT nor KEYMAP is set in rc.conf).

Writing "loadfont -m ru-utf UniCyr_8x16" in an executable startup file is what
I call "direct configuration", as opposed to setting variables which indirectly affect
loadkeys call later. It's equivalent semantically, but shorter and, well, direct.


Why direct configuration?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Direct configuration is always simpler, but it's not the only advantage.
It's much less system-dependent, more versatile, and generally much better documented.

In this example, loadkeys is pretty much a standard Linux utility, coming from either
kbd package or busybox. There's loadkeys(1) man page in almost any system.
On the other hand, rc.conf is Arch-specific. It's necessary to consult Arch wiki to
find out which variables to set, and in most non-trivial cases also check /etc/rc.sysninit
for the actual commands.
And then you go to some Ubuntu system, and start digging through its own, ridiculously complicated,
indirect configuration scripts just to find out how the same utility (loadkeys) is started on that
particular system.

Adding a level of abstraction over loadkeys could make sense if loadkeys was ridiculously
difficult to use. It is not, and even if it were, the Linux way to fix that is rewriting
loadkeys, not adding wrappers atop.


Pre-existing implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Direct configuration has been used for a long time in a specific area: iptables and shaper
configuration. Due to complexity of the commands involved, iptables configuration was almost
invariably stored as initialization code, as opposed to data.
Even tools like iptables-save/iptables-restore stay close to command syntax.

In a way, the iptables example shows the blurry line between data-definition and code-definition
of the initial system state.


Keeping startup scripts simple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Few people seem to get it, but Linux is very easy to boot.
Most of the time one needs just a handful of mostly independent commands to get a fully
usable system.
Still, most distributions tend to push unnecessary complex, poorly documented
startup scripts. Sometimes to ridiculous degrees, like this little pearl from my Arch system:

	/etc/config/ntpd	(host-specific file)

	# arguments passed to ntpd when started
	NTPD_ARGS="-g -u ntp"

Just making /etc/rc.d/ntpd (which currently loads /etc/config/ntpd) a configuration file
and editing that file would have the same effect.


Implications for sninit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Direct configuration can be implemented with pretty much any init, it is not sninit-specific.
However, sninit was written with direct configuration in mind.

sninit strongly assumes /etc/inittab is a host-specific configuration file.
This was the key consideration for @dir lines syntax, in particular (not) implementing sleep
hooks as a w-type initdir.

If inittab was a distro-specific, distro-updatable and generally non-changeable file,
it would make sense to do something like this:

	@8:once:/etc/rc/sleep

with said directory containing basically what pm-tools call "hooks". Configuration like
this would allow users to add their own hooks without changing the (distro-supplied) inittab.

(It would also allow the distro to install additional hooks without the need for users
to do any manual configuration, as it is done with services. However, for sleep hooks it
is NOT relevant. Sleep hooks depend on hardware configuration more than on anything else,
and hardware is specific to each individual system.)

Now assuming direct configuration approach, having a directory like this makes no sense.
Since /etc/inittab is assumed to be editable for each individual system, all sleep-related
configuration goes there. This keeps things readable.

Having ordered things in a file also removes the need to order files in a directory,
thus removing the need for all those 10-sd.sh, 20-network.sh and other lingering shadows
of our ZX BASIC past.
