Inittab syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Location: /etc/inittab (INITTAB in config.h)
Lines starting with # and empty lines are ignored.
The remaining lines should have one of the following formats:

	name=value
	flags	name	command

Example:

	# A sample minimalistic inittab

	# Environment setup
	PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin
	LOCALE=C
	LC_CTYPE=C

	# Initrec lines
	W1234568   hwc          /sbin/hwclock -s
	S1         sulogin      /bin/sulogin

Initdir (service) files, when present, are handled as if they were
appended at the end of inittab.
Each file is equivalent to one inittab line.
See below for initdir file format description.


Initrec lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each initrec describes a process to be run by init.
Initrec stores a single pid, so at each given time there can be at most
one process running per each initrec.
This pid may change, as in case of respawning processes, but only after
the existing process dies.

Syntax:

	code   name   command

name any string up to 7 (NAMELEN-1 in config.h) characters long.
Use "-" to set empty name; for s-type records, non-empty names, should be unique.
Name is used in telinit start/stop commands and for logging.
Example: "mountfs", "tty2"

code is a set of characters denoting entry type, runlevels and optional process flags.

	S		Restart process in case it dies. s-type record.

	W		Wait before this process finishes before proceeding to
                        the next one; w-type record, see below.
	O		Neither wait nor respawn the process; o-type record.

	H		Like S, but wait for other processes to die before killing this one.

	0..9		primary runlevel
	a..f		secondary runlevel (sublevel, see sublevels.txt)

	Y		Provide process with a controlling tty (aka interactive mode).
			Same as + before command in sysvinit.

	N		Redirect stdout and stderr to /dev/null

	A		When stopping process, use SIGABRT instead of SIGTERM

command: the command to run. Normally this field is split into argv array
similar to how it happens in sh(1) and passed directly to execve(2). 
Quoted arguments are respected; variable substitutions, redirects and other
shell-specific things aren't.


Environment lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Processes started by init can not use any environment set up by any kind
of init script like it's typically done with sysvinit.
This is especially true for processes started without sh wrapping
(sh can process /etc/profile before executing the command).
Thus all environment the process needs must be provided by init via
the third argument of execve(2).

sninit keeps a fixed environment and passes it to every process it runs.
Syntax:

	name=value

The variables appear in envp[] in the same order they are listed in the file.
All processes get exactly the same environment, even if some variables were
declared below resp. initrec line.

Variable substitution is never performed, all values must be literal.


Initdir files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Location: /etc/rc/* (INITDIR in config.h)
Each file provides a single initrec. Only s-type (respawn) records are allowed,
due to files in directory being inherently unordered.

Two possible formats are recognized: pure service file, and a script.
The first (and possibly the second) line of the file is used to determine its type.
Pure service file, command is parsed and used in execve(2) call:

	#:code
	command

Script:

	#!interpreter
	#:code
	....

Scripts must be executable (in chmod(2) sense, S_IX{USR,OTH}).
Neither the interpreter line nor the contents of script files are parsed.
Instead, execve(2) gets the script name itself.

In both cases the file's basename is used for the name field in initrec.


How sninit works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During startup, sninit compiles all initrecs from inittab and initdir into an ordered list.
Entries from inittab come first, exactly in the same order as they appear in inittab.
The order of the entries from initdir is not defined (and depends on how getdents(2) reads
the directory), but they all come after inittab entries.

Next, sninit runs through the list, and spawns all processes that
should be spawned for a given runlevel.
When spawning w-type entries, sninit breaks the loop and waits until the processes dies.
Upon encountering s-type entries whose process died, sninit respawns the process.
o-type entries are neither waited for nor respawned.
Processes which are running but aren't intended for current runlevel are killed.
The loop is re-run as needed.

When reconfiguration is requested, sninit compiles the new configuration,
transferring existing process data (pids etc) for matching entries.
For named entries, name is used as the key.
Un-named entries are not transferred.
