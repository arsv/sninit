Setting child process limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is potentially useful to allow setting certain per-process caps
from within init, like setuid/setgid calls, ulimits (setrlimit(2)),
capabilities and possibly cgroups.

There are two principal approaches to the problem:
	1. doing it all in init

		fork()
		setrlimits()
		capset()
		...
		exec(daemon)

	2. doing it all in a companion utility
	
		fork()
		exec(companion [limits] daemon)
		setrlimits()
		capset()
		exec(daemon)

This file contains some thoughts that went into the decision
of using a companion utility vs having it all built into init.

NOTE: the following deals with the original sysvtab configuration
format. The resulting decision to move child-side code out of init
was one of the main drives behind the move to newtab.
See newtab.txt for explaination.


Built-in limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pros:
    * no additional processes
    * no dependencies, all that's needed to run a process is stored
      in compiled inittab.
    * no need to separate parent-side and child-side flags in inittab
      (parent: wait, possibly null, tty; child: limits, uid/gid and so on)
Cons:
    * rarely-used code in init
    * configure() must read passwd/group
    * passwd is read very early
    * can't run processes in the same conditions outside of init
    * data must be stored, since it's applied much later than it is read
    * no way to drop privileges mid-point

Companion utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pros:
    * keeps init clean
    * loaded only when needed
    * can be used outside of init, incl. to test init-controlled
      processes in the same conditions init will run them.
    * similar to existing tools (su, nice, cgexec), common unix approach
    * passwd is read late
    * simple code, read & apply immediately because everything
      happens in the child
    * limits can be set at any given point
Cons:
    * more syscalls
    * additional external dependency
    * separation of inittab flags into parent/child blocks
    * takes more space than the same code in init


Parent/child flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some flags natually dealing with parent-only stuff, some straddling
the line, and some clearly child-only.

    * wait, once, last — parent only
    * abort, time to restart — parent only
    * log — needs initrec name, normally not available past exec()
    * null — stradles the line, re. closing/not closing inherited fds
    * tty — child only, but traditionally implemented in parent
    * uid, gid — child-only

Doing everything in init means it's ok to leave all them intermixed.
For companion untility, some way is needed to separate parent and child-related
flags, and probably to pass things like initrec name to child when needed
(which is not always by the way).


Separating parent and child flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This turns out to be mostly syntactic issue:

(1)	daemon:1234:log,null,~daemonuser,%dcgroup:/sbin/daemon

versus

(2)	daemon:1234:log,null:/sbin/runcap ~daemonuser,%dcgroup /sbin/daemon

In both cases, init compiles ~daemonuser,%dcgroup into its internal inittab
representation, it's just the form that differs.

In the first case, init is expected to handle semantics of those fields,
i.e. to note that "daemonuser" is a name to setuid() to, and "dcgroup" is
cgroup name, probably splitting them into relevant initrec fields.

In the second case, the whole "~daemonuser,%dcgroup" string is stored in
initrec.argv[1] as is, without any parsing.

Aside from having caps in different parts of the initline, the only principal
difference between (1) and (2) is error reporting. With early parsing in (1),
this may happen at telinit q stage. Late parsing (2) means init will see cap
parsing errors as daemon's failure to start.

How much of a problem it is? The answer is not clear, few caps allow parsing
errors, and those that do (setuid for instance) may actually benefit from late
name resolving.


Early vs late name resolving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With built-in caps implementation, it makes sense to store userids in compiled
inittab, not usernames. Thus init must read passwd in configure(), which
happens very very early in the boot process. Possibly before even mounting
the real root, say, in case pivot_root is involved. In contrast, anything
child-side will read passwd at the time process is spawned.

On the other hand, nothing really prevents one from storing username in
compiled inittab and doing late passwd even with the code built in into init.

Using early username resolution certain advantages, too. Namely, once inittab
has been compiled, it does not depend on external files anymore.


Dropping priviledges mid-way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider initialization which must be performed with higher priviledge level
than the "main" process. Something like creating cache directories, chowning
them to daemon's uid and starting the daemon with that uid.

In a case like that, dropping priviledges in init, right after exec(),
is a bad idea. On the other hand, a standalone utility works really well:

	test ! -d $CACHE && mkdir $CACHE && chown $daemonuser $CACHE
	runas $daemonuser /sbin/daemon

This is also in line with tools like nice and cgexec.


Update on capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All support for capset(2) has been removed from the companion utility,
and its name has been changed to just "run". Current implementation
of capabilities in linux kernel make them useless for the purpose.

The rest of this document still applies, the companion utility
is currently used to set all child-side process attributes.


Further update on capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux 3.5 with its PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS seems to be a move in the right
direction, but there is still no way to move bits from bounding
to effective set without an exec call.
