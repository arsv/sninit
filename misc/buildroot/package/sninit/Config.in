	  sninit comes with a minimalistic libc implementation
	  that provides just the necessary functions.

	  Linking against bundled libc results in smallest possible
	  static executables, but it is only available on certain platforms.

	  With this option disabled, init will be linked against whatever
	  libc has been chosen for the whole system (uClibc, musl etc).

config BR2_PACKAGE_SNINIT_DEBUG
	bool "Debug mode"
	default y
	help
	  Disable optimization and enable debugging symbols.

	  Buildroot strips target executables, but those in output/build/
	  retain their symbols. The target executable can be run under
	  gdbserver in qemu and non-stripped one can be loaded into
	  target-gdb for a remote debugging session.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SNINIT_BUILTIN_INITTAB

	help
	  Fallback inittab to use if /etc/inittab on the target system
	  can not be read. This is compile-time option, and the file name
	  should be relative to buildroot directory.
