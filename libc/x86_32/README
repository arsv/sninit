x86_32, or in other words, x86_64 with short pointers.
Check ../x86_64/README for ABI and such.


Big fat warning: building sninit for x86_32 makes little sense.
Negligible net gain over x86_64 in the init process will likely be
offset by not-so-negligible increase in the kernel size needed
to support x86_32.

The only situation I can think of that warrants x32 init executable
is a kernel without regular x86_64 syscalls, which is not something
that can be built easily.


This arch is more of a experiment for the sake of experiment,
not something intended for real use. It is not well tested too.
